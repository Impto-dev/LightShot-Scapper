# LightShot-Scraper
This scraper allows you to download as many images as you like from the "prnt.sc" website. This scraper works because of the sequential ID nature of the website. Each image has a 6 character long alphanumeric string. This way a user can easily generate strings and then download the images. </br> </br>
